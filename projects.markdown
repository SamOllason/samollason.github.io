I actively build small and fun side projects to continue learning and developing my skillset outside of the my day-to-day role.

Sometimes I build medium/large projects that are a prototype of a product I am interested in, and others are small bite-sized projects designed to explore a single concept to increase my intuition and share learnings with others.

* **Route Sniffer** — AI-powered dog walking route planner I designed and built end-to-end. Frustrated that no app could generate unique routes for adventures with my Springer Spaniel, Obi, I built my own solution. Orchestrated multiple AI/map APIs into a single request pipeline using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Supabase. Implemented React Server Components with optimistic UI updates. Engineered for cost-efficiency: ~$0.04 per AI-generated route. <a href="https://github.com/SamOllason/woof-woof-walkies" target="_blank">GitHub →</a>

* **Bird migration game** - I built a very small bird migration modelling game to explore state in a system and explore the difference between explicitly modelling state and implicitly modelling state. <a href="https://samollason.github.io/ui-state-modelling-demo/" target="_blank">Live demo →</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SamOllason/ui-state-modelling-demo" target="_blank">GitHub →</a>.

* **GraphQL + Apollo + TypeScript playground** - Minimal project to explore end-to-end GraphQL workflow and setup. Bonus points if you manage to find how I snuck in a dog theme 😉 <a href="https://github.com/SamOllason/GraphQL-Apollo-Playground" target="_blank">GitHub →</a>.
