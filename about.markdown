I'm Sam Ollason and I'm a software engineer. Here you can find my blog posts
and a selected list of the talks I have given.
 
I write blogs as a record of what I have learnt and to share what I have learnt with other people. This helps me clarify what I have learnt
and hopefully help others to learn as well. I'm a self-taught developer and I'm
passionate about helping others learn and improve their skills too.

The topics are a mixture of what I have been working on 'professionally',
personal projects I am working on and things I am learning on the side.

My day job is working as a software engineer at [Seccl](https://seccl.tech) where I work
across the stack with JavaScript technologies. Outside of work
I run and volunteer with [GoodGym](https://www.goodgym.org/runners/sam-ollason?page=4),
 follow Bath rugby and play boardgames.

This blog was created with
[Jekyll](jekyll-organization) using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and hosted
on GitHub Pages.
