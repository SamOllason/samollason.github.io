My name is Sam Ollason and I'm a software engineer. Here you can find my blog posts
and a selected list of the talks I have given.
 
 I write blogs to record and share what I have been learning. This helps me clarify what I have learnt
 and hopefully help others to learn as well. I'm a self-taught developer and I'm
passionate about helping others learn and improve their skills too.

I am particularly interested in emerging technologies, fundamentals of
software engineering and compilers.

My day job is working as a software engineer at [Seccl](https://seccl.tech) where I work
across the stack with JavaScript technologies. Outside of work
I run and volunteer with [GoodGym](https://www.goodgym.org/runners/sam-ollason?page=4),
 follow Bath rugby and play boardgames.

This blog was created with
[Jekyll](jekyll-organization) using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and hosted
on GitHub Pages.
