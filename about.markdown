## Hey, I'm Sam 👋

I build tools that solve real problems.

I've spent 8+ years shipping products across insurance, fintech, and wealth management—building disruptive zero-to-one products from scratch and scaling platforms to millions of users.

I've worked across software engineering, product management, and founding startups. I love being able to move between business strategy, product strategy, and code.

**Currently:** Senior Software Engineer + Interim Engineering Manager @ Howden (global insurance group)

**Tech I work with:**
- Front-End: TypeScript, JavaScript, Blazor, React, React Native, Redux, D3.js
- Back-End: C#, .NET, Node.js, Express, Next.js
- Cloud: Azure, AWS Lambda, Firebase
- Databases: MongoDB, Supabase

**Certifications:** Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (May 2025)

When I'm not building things, I'm cheering on Bath Rugby or walking my dog Obi through the countryside around Bath, England.

## About this blog

I write to capture what I've learned and share it with others. It helps me clarify my thinking and hopefully helps you learn something too.

I'm a self-taught developer, so I'm passionate about helping others learn and improve their skills.

The topics mix what I'm working on professionally, personal projects, and things I'm exploring on the side.

This site was built with [Jekyll](jekyll-organization) using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
