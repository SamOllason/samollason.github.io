Here are some of the resources that I have found useful over the years. 

# Web Development + JavaScript

* [Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) - I wish I had this when I first got into software
development, it would have my learning curve a lot more efficient. Andrei is one of the best
teachers I have come across. This is where to start if you have never programmed before, or to fill
 in any gas in your knowledge if you are self-taught. Enjoy!
* [The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/) - Best resource I found to fill in the gaps
in my knowledge and and stop feeling like I was a junior dev.
* [Learn Node by Wes Bos](https://learnnode.com/?utm_source=wesboscom&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=launchpost) - Wes focuses more on 'how to' instead of 'why' so this course is useful 
to actually learn how to do stuff with Node and server-side JavaScript but skips over the deeper
points. Entertaining and engaging, I found this useful to get more experience further down
the stack.
* [JavaScripts: The Advanced Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-javascript-concepts/) - Essential
topics for anyone who wants to understand 'why' JavaScript works as it does and to understand
deeper topics. In my mind you can't be a 'senior' JavaScript developer without understanding some of these concepts.
 * [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) -
  Some really important concepts that are useful in all types of programming (stacks, queues, lists).
  Recommended for any self-taught devs who want to brush up on the fundamentals.

# Compilers

* [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) - Fantastic and very readable
introduction to designing programming languages and creating compilers.
I am slowly working through this book and following along with creating an interpreter for.

# Design patterns

* [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog) - Really engaging and 
clear explanations of the common object design patterns and how/when to use them (free resource, or you
can optionally buy the eBook to support the project).
